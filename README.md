In the initial phase, handwritten samples from various individuals are collected. Next, a database is created by segmenting the images at the letter level and classifying each character based on the writer. This process generates a dataset containing 80-100 examples for each letter per person. Machine learning and deep learning models are then trained to classify letters according to their author. During testing, words are segmented into individual letters, which are assigned to specific writers. The person with the highest number of assigned letters is identified as the most likely author of the word.
